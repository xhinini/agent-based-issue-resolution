Test Analysis:\n#### Test Failures and Root Causes:\nThe test output shows two errors and two failures:\n- **Errors (`test_hash`, `test_hash_nested`)**: These occur due to attempts to hash `ValidationError` objects. The `TypeError: unhashable type: 'ValidationError'` suggests that `ValidationError` objects have not been made hashable in the relevant context of the test case.\n  \n- **Failures (`test_eq`, `test_eq_nested`)**: Both tests fail because they expect `ValidationError` objects with the same messages to not be equal, but the implementation in both patches allows for equal errors if their messages are identical. This suggests the expectation set in the test cases and the intended behavior in the patches are not aligned.\n  \n#### Parts of the Code Being Tested:\nThe main focus is on the `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods of the `ValidationError` class, which are intended to determine when two instances should be considered equal and how they should be hashed, if at all.\n\n#### Comparison of Test Behavior:\n- **Gold Patch**: Passes tests as it presumably implements hashing and equality in line with Django\u2019s expected functionality requirements for `ValidationError`.\n  \n- **Model Patch**: Fails due to lack of hash implementation and differences in equality check outcomes. The model's `__eq__` method disregards hashing entirely, focusing only on messages and error structures.\n\n### 2. Patch Comparison:\n#### Syntactic and Semantic Differences:\n- **Gold Patch**:\n  - Implements both `__eq__` and `__hash__`.\n  - Uses `make_hashable` to handle parameters and dictionaries for hash calculation.\n  - Compares `hash(self)` to `hash(other)` for equality, which is dependent on the hash implementation.\n  - Handles both `error_dict` and `error_list` conditions semantically by ignoring order.\n \n- **Model Patch**:\n  - Implements `__eq__` focusing mainly on the equality of normalized messages and error dictionaries.\n  - Lacks the `__hash__` method, causing type errors in tests that expect hashing capability.\n  - Focuses on sorting normalized messages for comparison but does not hash.\n\n#### Key Changes:\n- **Equality**: Both patches introduce `__eq__` methods. The gold patch employs hash comparison while the model patch focuses on structure and order-agnostic checks on messages.\n \n- **Hashability**: Only the gold patch attempts to make `ValidationError` instances hashable.\n\n#### Core Issue Addressed:\nThe core issue is addressed by both patches through added methods for comparison. However, the gold patch goes further to ensure hashability, which aligns with the test expectations.\n\n### 3. Problem Classification:\n#### Bug Type:\n- This is primarily categorized as a **design enhancement** rather than a bug. It involves extending functionality for intuitive behavior in object comparisons.\n\n#### Domain Knowledge:\n- Requires understanding of object equality and hashing in Python, particularly with Django\u2019s error handling.\n- Requires comprehension of how `ValidationError` objects are structured in Django.\n\n#### Dependencies and Context:\n- Depends primarily on Python\u2019s object model and Django\u2019s exception infrastructure.\n- Involves Django utilities (e.g., `make_hashable`) for efficient hash comparisons.\n\n### 4. Model Performance Analysis:\n#### Failure Reasons:\n- The model fails predominantly due to the omission of hash implementation, leading to `TypeError` when a hash is expected.\n  \n#### Model's Approach Pattern:\n- Focus is on error message normalization and comparison without considering broader context requirements, like hashability.\n\n#### Core Problem Understanding:\n- The model appears to understand the need for equality but lacks alignment with Django's requirement for a hashable `ValidationError`.\n\n### 5. Repair Strategy Analysis:\n#### Strategy Comparison:\n- **Gold Patch**: Uses a comprehensive approach by including both equality and hash implementation, ensuring robustness in functionality.\n  \n- **Model Patch**: Misses hash-related concepts and only partially completes the functionality needed for testing requirements.\n\n#### Missing Knowledge or Context:\n- Missing understanding of the need for `__hash__` in the context of Django\u2019s failure scenario tests.\n- Over-reliance on message-based equality without considering implementation requirements for hashed collections (lists, sets).\n\n#### Required Reasoning Steps:\n1. Understand how `ValidationError` integrates into Django\u2019s broader workflow, especially in testing.\n2. Implement both `__eq__` and `__hash__` to meet the full breadth of validity checks.\n3. Consider the use cases and implement checks that align with how Django handles similar entities.\n4. Test to validate the integrated behavior aligns with Django\u2019s expectations for these object types."
