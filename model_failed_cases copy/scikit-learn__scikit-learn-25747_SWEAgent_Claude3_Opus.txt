### ISSUE TYPE
bug fix

### DESCRIPTION
FeatureUnion not working when aggregating data and pandas transform output selected
### Describe the bug

I would like to use `pandas` transform output and use a custom transformer in a feature union which aggregates data. When I'm using this combination I got an error. When I use default `numpy` output it works fine.

### Steps/Code to Reproduce

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
from sklearn import set_config
from sklearn.pipeline import make_union

index = pd.date_range(start="2020-01-01", end="2020-01-05", inclusive="left", freq="H")
data = pd.DataFrame(index=index, data=[10] * len(index), columns=["value"])
data["date"] = index.date


class MyTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def fit(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series | None = None, **kwargs):
        return self

    def transform(self, X: pd.DataFrame, y: pd.Series | None = None) -> pd.DataFrame:
        return X["value"].groupby(X["date"]).sum()


# This works.
set_config(transform_output="default")
print(make_union(MyTransformer()).fit_transform(data))

# This does not work.
set_config(transform_output="pandas")
print(make_union(MyTransformer()).fit_transform(data))
```

### Expected Results

No error is thrown when using `pandas` transform output.

### Actual Results

```python
