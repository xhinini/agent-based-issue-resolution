=== Applied Patterns ===

=== Original Error Messages ===
However, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:
TypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`

=== Test Verification Results ===
Tests Passed: False
